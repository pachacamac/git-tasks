# git-tasks

Have a SCRUM/KANBAN like task board, based on plain text files, directly in your git repository.


# Installation / usage

1) clone repo
2) bundle install
3) rackup
4) go to http://localhost:9292
5) amaze!

Oh and the repo should have a folder called `tasks`. In there should be a few folders like this: `10-todo`, `20-in_progress`, `30-done` etc.
